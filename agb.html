Should one of the provisions of these GTC or the order be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the GTC or the order in other respects. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision whose effects most closely approximate the economic objective pursued by the contracting parties with the invalid or unenforceable provision. The same shall apply in the event of a loophole.</p>
